# Analysis of Drug Types for Diabetes Management Using a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Approach

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing various drug types used for diabetes management using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) machine learning algorithm. The goal is to explore the relationship between different drug treatments and diabetes outcomes, enabling better decision-making in prescribing medication and understanding which drugs work best for different patient profiles.

## Introduction
Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects millions of people worldwide. The treatment options for diabetes include various types of medications such as insulin, sulfonylureas, DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, and more. This project aims to analyze the effectiveness of these drug types in managing diabetes through the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) machine learning algorithm.

The project uses historical medical data to predict the most effective drug treatments based on patient characteristics such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and blood glucose levels.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains patient records, including:
- Patient demographics (age, gender, etc.)
- Diabetes-related information (blood glucose levels, HbA1c levels, BMI, etc.)
- Drug types and treatment outcomes (blood sugar levels post-treatment)

The data can be obtained from publicly available healthcare datasets or synthetic data generated for research purposes.

## Methodology
This project employs the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm for drug prediction:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data, handle missing values, scale the features, and encode categorical variables.
- **Model Training**: Use the KNN algorithm to classify patients into groups based on the most effective drug treatment for managing their diabetes.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the KNN model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### KNN Overview
KNN is a simple, yet powerful, classification algorithm that makes predictions based on the majority class of the nearest neighbors. For this project, KNN will be used to classify patients according to the most suitable drug type based on their medical features.

This script will:
- Load and preprocess the dataset.
- Train the KNN model.
- Evaluate the model and display performance metrics.

## Results
The analysis will provide insights into:
- The effectiveness of different drug types for managing diabetes.
- The factors that influence treatment success.
- The model performance metrics and recommendations for the best drug options based on patient data.
